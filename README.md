# ML-Project-Insurance-Premium-Prediction
This Project predicts insurance premiums using machine learning based on the factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and more. This project was the part Codebasics ML Course.

## Overview
This project aims to predict insurance premiums based on various customer factors using machine learning. It is inspired by a course from Codebasics. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region, all of which influence the insurance premium amount.

The project walks through the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages, using popular machine learning techniques for regression.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Machine Learning Models:** 
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Ridge and Lasso Regression
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate performance.
